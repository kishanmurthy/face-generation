# face-generation
A solution to udacity deep-learning nano degree face generation project.

### Info
This project uses generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces. The dataset 
[CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) 
used to train the model consists of faces of celebities. 
The model generates new images similar to trained celebrity faces.
